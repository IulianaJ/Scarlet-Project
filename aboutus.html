                For over half a century our House has represented the rarest gemstones. Generations of the Scarlet
                family have employed their expertise and experience, personally selecting every stone and – uniquely
                among diamond houses – presiding over every step of its journey. No stage is bypassed. No shortcuts are
                taken. Only perfection matters.

                Discovering the most brilliant gem-quality diamonds demands an expedition deep into the earth, the most
                challenging treasure hunt imaginable. Day after day, our gemologists strive to uncover gemstones that
                equal
                or surpass the finest diamonds ever unearthed. Often many millions of years old, every Scarlet stone is
                responsibly mined and traceable to its source.

                In the rough, a diamond has yet to reveal its secrets: it might become a cascade of small gems or a
                single,
                perfectly cut stone. Our gemologists can spend months exploring the possibilities. When they have
                determined
                the optimal cut – however ambitious it may be – the diamond’s fate is set.
                The task of our cutters and polishers requires astonishing dexterity, precision and patience. It is due
                to
                their skill and vision that Scarlet can unlock the hidden radiance of the world’s most magnificent gems.
                With limitless passion and the steadiest of hands, they bring each stone to life, unlocking its
                exceptional
                beauty, time after time.
